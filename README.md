## Project Overview

The Mail Code system uses a two-part code to facilitate secure communication:

- **Public Code (XXXXXXX)**: A unique identifier that you can share freely with others.
- **Private Code (YYYYYY)**: Acts as a security measure, similar to a door access card. Each Private Code is unique to the sender-receiver pair.

## How It Works

1. **Creating an Account**: Sign up on the Mail Code platform to get your unique Public Code.
2. **Generating Private Codes**: For each contact you want to communicate with, generate a unique Private Code.
3. **Sending Mail**: When someone wants to send you a message, they need to enter both your Public Code and the unique Private Code you provided them.
4. **Preventing Spam**: If you receive unwanted messages, simply revoke the Private Code used by the sender. This will prevent them from sending you any more messages using that code.

Both receiver and sender must be registered to the platform.

## Features

- **Spam Prevention**: Easily revoke Private Codes to block unwanted messages.
- **Security**: Private Codes act as an additional security layer, making it difficult for spammers to send you unsolicited messages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Compatible with both mobile and desktop devices for seamless communication.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Laravel
- **Frontend Framework**: VueJS
- **Languages**:PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Cloud Platform**: Heroku
