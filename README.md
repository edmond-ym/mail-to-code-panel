# Mail Code Communication Tool

Welcome to the Mail Code Communication Tool! This project is designed to provide a secure and spam-free alternative to traditional email systems by using a unique Mail Code system for each user.

## Project Overview

The Mail Code system uses a two-part code to facilitate secure communication:

- **Public Code (XXXXXXX)**: A unique identifier that you can share freely with others.
- **Private Code (YYYYYY)**: Acts as a security measure, similar to a door access card. Each Private Code is unique to the sender-receiver pair.

## How It Works

1. **Creating an Account**: Sign up on the Mail Code platform to get your unique Public Code.
2. **Generating Private Codes**: For each contact you want to communicate with, generate a unique Private Code.
3. **Sending Mail**: When someone wants to send you a message, they need to enter both your Public Code and the unique Private Code you provided them.
4. **Preventing Spam**: If you receive unwanted messages, simply revoke the Private Code used by the sender. This will prevent them from sending you any more messages using that code.

## Features

- **Spam Prevention**: Easily revoke Private Codes to block unwanted messages.
- **Security**: Private Codes act as an additional security layer, making it difficult for spammers to send you unsolicited messages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Compatible with both mobile and desktop devices for seamless communication.
